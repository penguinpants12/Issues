Today i was starting a new character the mage. So i got to the Grave Digger quest and i tryed completing it. But when i gave 
him the rotten flesh... He asked for more rotten flesh. So therefore i went and got more rotten flesh and gave it to him. 
But he didnt take it. But i have access to the gravyard and he let me in to get the will. So i tryed giving him the will 
and that didnt let me. Therefore i cannot complete this challenge.
